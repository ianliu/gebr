**GêBR** is a simple graphical interface which facilitates geophysical data processing. **GêBR** is not a *package for processing*. Instead it is designed to integrate a large variety of free processing packages, such as Seismic Un*x and Madagascar, and your own softwares.

**GêBR** manages seismic-data processing projects, dealing with several 2D lines, each one with its own set of processing flows. Through **GêBR**, it is possible to assemble and execute such processing flows and track the outputs of the data processing. Everything in a simple and friendly way.

Being a free software, anyone can use and customize **GêBR** for free, according to the terms of the GNU Public License. That makes this software very attractive for teaching and academic research.
