Description: GeBR library collection
 GeBR is an environment to seismic processing based on open-source
 technologies, designed to easily assembly and run processing flows.
 .
 What GeBR does:
 .
     * Handle projects and lines
     * Assembly and run processing flows
     * Act as an interface to many freely-available seismic-processing
       packages (Seismic Unix, Madagascar, etc)
 .
 libgebr is the collection of libraries of GeBR:
     * libgebr_comm deals with client-server communication
     * libgebr_geoxml is the XML engine of GeBR
     * libgebr_gui extends GTK+ functionalities
     * libgebr_misc is where everything else is
