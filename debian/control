Description: GeBR library collection
 GêBR is a simple graphical interface which facilitates geophysical data processing. 
 GêBR is not a package for processing, rather it is designed to integrate a large 
 variety of free processing packages.
 .
 What can GeBR do:
     * Handle Projects and Lines
     * Assembly and run processing sequences
     * Act as an interface to many freely-available seismic-processing
       packages (Seismic Unix, Madagascar, etc)
 .
 libgebr is a collection of GeBR's libraries:
     * libgebr_comm deals with client-server communication
     * libgebr_geoxml is the XML engine of GeBR
     * libgebr_gui extends GTK+ functionalities
     * libgebr_misc is where everything else is
 .
