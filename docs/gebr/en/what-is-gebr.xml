  <title>What is GêBR?</title>
  <para>GêBR is a simple graphical
    interface<indexterm><primary>GêBR</primary><secondary>the
    interface</secondary></indexterm> which <emphasis>facilitates
    geophysical data processing</emphasis>. GêBR is <emphasis>not a
    package for processing</emphasis>, it is designed
    to <emphasis>integrate</emphasis> a large variety of free
    processing packages, such as <emphasis>Seismic Un*x</emphasis>
    and <emphasis>Madagascar</emphasis>.</para>

  <para>GêBR can manage projects and lines, assemble and execute flows
    and follow the results of the data processing. Everything in a
    simple and friendly way.</para>

  <para>Being a <emphasis>free software</emphasis>, anyone can use and
    customize GêBR for free, according to the terms of the
    <emphasis>GNU Public License</emphasis>. That makes this software
    very attractive for academic research and for use in
    courses.</para>

    <title>GêBR Project</title>

    <para>The <emphasis>GêBR
    Project</emphasis><indexterm><primary>GêBR
    Project</primary></indexterm> was initially proposed to develop
    and promote the GêBR interface. During 2007–2008, the core team of
    developers had offered several courses on seismic processing with
    GêBR, at the most active research centers in Geophysics in
    Brazil. Around 200 students and professionals had direct
    contact with the project on that period. In that process the GêBR
    observed a demand for integration efforts among Brazilian
    geophysical community. That motivated a redefinition for the
    project’s goals.</para>

    <blockquote><emphasis>The main objective of GêBR is to stimulate the
    integration of the Brazilian Geophysical Community by providing an
    interface to geophysical data processing that could be used not
    only for teaching purposes but also as a research dissemination
    vehicle.</emphasis></blockquote>

        <title>What's new</title>
    <itemizedlist>
			<listitem>
				Version 0.20.0 <emphasis></emphasis>
				<itemizedlist>
						This release of GêBR brings a lot of new and features to ease 
						the handling and the management of flows and programs, including:
					<listitem>
						Joining of Program and Flow tabs navigation: now through Flows tab 
						is possible control all the actions about flows and programs, thus 
						the activities at GêBR are much more centralized, fast and easy.
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						New Toolbar: the new toolbar makes the GêBR interface much more clean. 
						Just the frequently used actions are on the toolbar, the other actions 
						are placed in More menu.
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						Improved usability of flows through the creation of 
						a unified tab (see 
						<xref linkend="flows_tab"/>).
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						Possibility to restore important states of the user's
						flow (see 
						<xref linkend="flows_snapshots"/>).
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				Version 0.18.0 <emphasis>(May 24th 2012: current)</emphasis>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						Prior to this version, lines could have some directories,
						known as <emphasis>line's paths</emphasis>. Shortcuts to
						those directories were available in each file browse
						dialog. From this version, to each line it is associated a
						standard hierarchy of directories (see definition in
						<xref linkend="projects_lines_line_paths"/> and example of
						usage in <xref linkend="flows_edit_input_output"/>).
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						Now it's possible to change the line's maestro (see
						<xref linkend="projects_lines_change_the_maestro_of_a_line"/>).
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						GêBR correctly displays remote folder (see
						<xref linkend="technical_aspects_remote_browsing"/>).
					</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>
			</listitem>
			<listitem>
				Version 0.16.0<emphasis> (January 30th 2012)</emphasis>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>The concept of <emphasis>Maestro</emphasis> is born,
						allowing to execute
						jobs in multiples machines.  (see
						<xref linkend="additional_features_maestro_servers_configuration"
							/> and <xref linkend="technical_aspects_multicores"
							/>).</listitem>
					<listitem>Now it is possible to control the number of cores
						used by the jobs of GêBR and change the priority of
						execution of a job (see
						<xref linkend="technical_aspects_multicores" /> and
						<xref linkend="technical_aspects_priority_execution"
							/>).</listitem>
					<listitem>Renewed interface: new functionalities and
						improved usability.</listitem>
				</itemizedlist>

			<listitem>
				Version 0.14.0 <emphasis>(October 3rd 2011):</emphasis>
				<itemizedlist>
					<listitem>
						The variables dictionary and the program parameters accept
						arithmetic expressions (see section
						<xref linkend="technical_aspects_dictionary_variables"/>).
					</listitem>
					<listitem>
						Repetitive processes can be automatized by the use of
						loops (see section <xref linkend="flows_loop"/>).
