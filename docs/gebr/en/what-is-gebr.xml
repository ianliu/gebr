  <title>What is GêBR?</title>
  <para>GêBR is a simple graphical interface which 
    <emphasis>facilitates geophysical data processing</emphasis>. GêBR is 
    <emphasis>not a package for processing</emphasis>, it is designed to 
    <emphasis>integrate</emphasis> a large variety of free processing packages, such as 
    <emphasis>Seismic Un*x</emphasis> and 
    <emphasis>Madagascar</emphasis>.</para>
  <para>GêBR can manage Projects and Lines, assemble and execute Flows and follow the results of
    your data processing. Everything in a simple and friendly way.</para>
  <para>Being a 
    <emphasis>free software</emphasis>, anyone can use and customize GêBR for free,
    according to the terms of the 
    <emphasis>GNU Public License</emphasis>. That makes this software very attractive for academic
    research and for use in courses.</para>

      <listitem>Now it is possible to control the number of cores used by the jobs of GêBR and
        change the priority of execution of a job (see 
        <xref linkend="flow_editor_multicores" /> and 
        <xref linkend="flow_editor_priority_execution" />).</listitem>
