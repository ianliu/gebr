  <title>What is GêBR?</title>
  <para>GêBR is a simple graphical interface which 
    <emphasis>facilitates geophysical data processing</emphasis>. GêBR is 
    <emphasis>not a package for processing</emphasis>, it is designed to 
    <emphasis>integrate</emphasis> a large variety of free processing packages, such as 
    <emphasis>Seismic Un*x</emphasis> and 
    <emphasis>Madagascar</emphasis>.</para>
  <para>GêBR can manage Projects and Lines, assemble and execute Flows and follow the results of
    your data processing. Everything in a simple and friendly way.</para>
  <para>Being a 
    <emphasis>free software</emphasis>, anyone can use and customize GêBR for free,
    according to the terms of the 
    <emphasis>GNU Public License</emphasis>. That makes this software very attractive for academic
    research and for use in courses.</para>

    <title>GêBR Project</title>

    <para>The <emphasis>GêBR Project</emphasis> was initially proposed
    to develop and promote the GêBR interface. During 2007–2008, the
    core team of developers had offered several courses on seismic
    processing with GêBR, at the most active research centers in
    Geophysics in Brazil. Around 200 students and professionals have
    had direct contact with the project in that period. In that
    process we observed a demand for integration efforts among
    Brazilian geophysical community. That motivated a redefinition for
    the project’s goals.</para>

    <blockquote><emphasis>Our main objective is to to stimulate the
    integration of the Brazilian Geophysical Community by providing an
    interface to geophysical data processing that could be used not
    only for teaching purposes but also as a research dissemination
    vehicle.</emphasis></blockquote>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        Version 0.18.0 <emphasis>(May 12th 2012: current)</emphasis>
        <itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    Prior to this version, Lines could have some directories, known as <emphasis>Line's paths</emphasis>. Shortcuts
	    to those directories were available in each file browse dialog. From this version, to each Line it is associated a standard
	    hierarchy of directories (see definition in <xref linkend="projects_lines_line_paths"/>
	    and example of usage in <xref linkend="flow_editor_edit_input_output"/>).
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    Now it's possible to change the Line's Maestro (see <xref linkend="projects_lines_change_the_maestro_of_a_line"/>).
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    GêBR correctly displays remote folder (see <xref linkend="flow_editor_remote_browsing"/>).
	  </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        Version 0.16.0<emphasis> (January 30th 2012)</emphasis>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>The maestro concept is born allowing to execute GêBR jobs in multiples machines.
            (see 
            <xref linkend="additional_features_maestro_servers_configuration" /> and 
            <xref linkend="flow_editor_multiple_machines" />).</listitem>
          <listitem>Now it is possible to control the number of cores used by the jobs of GêBR and
            change the priority of execution of a job (see 
            <xref linkend="flow_editor_multicores" /> and 
            <xref linkend="flow_editor_priority_execution" />).</listitem>
          <listitem>Renewed interface: new functionalities and improved usability</listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </listitem>
      <para>
      </para>
      <listitem>
        Version 0.14.0 <emphasis>(October 3rd 2011):</emphasis>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            The variables dictionary and the program parameters accept arithmetic expressions (see section <xref linkend="dictionary_variables"/>).
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            Repetitive processes can be automatized by the use of loops (see section <xref linkend="flow_editor_loop"/>).
