  <title>The <guilabel>Flows</guilabel> tab</title>

  <para>
    The <guilabel>Flows</guilabel> tab is used to manage the flows of a
    particular line. Notice the similarity of this tab with the
    <guilabel>Projects and Lines</guilabel> tab.

    </figure>

  <para>
    The left panel contains the list of flows that composes the selected line
    in the previous tab, while the right panel exhibits information of the
    currently selected flow, divided in two parts:
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        On the top basic information such as flow title, last modification date
        and last execution date can be quickly consulted;
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        On the bottom there is a summary of the flow (see below), but this view
        can be switched to <guilabel>Snapshots</guilabel> view or
        <guilabel>Output</guilabel> view, according to the context. Further
        information is available on
        <xref linkend="flows_snapshots"/> and
        <xref linkend="flows_execution_infobar"/>.
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </para>

  <para>
    The default view of the right panel of the <guilabel>Flows</guilabel> tab
    contains a summary of the current flow. This view presents the input/output
    files, the programs and the parameters altered by the user (different from
    the provided values). Additionally, problems in the flow assembly are
    warned in this window. To go to the summary view, just select (single
    click) a flow. 
  </para>

  <tip>
    <para>
      You can perform searches on the flow summary by pressing
      <keycombo><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>F</keycap></keycombo>.

      accessible in the <emphasis>Flows</emphasis> tab, trough the button menu

    <para>After clicking the menu list button, a pop-up window is shown with a

      <para>A menu can appear more than once in the unfiltered list, since it

    <para>By typing parts of the menu title or description in the text box on
      the top, it is possible to filter the menus list. This eases the task of
      finding or discovering a menu when its domain is known. For example, it
      is possible to search for menus related to <emphasis>migration</emphasis>
      (see <xref linkend="flows_menus_list_filter" />).</para>

			It can be seen that:
			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>For the minimum number of cores, the flow lasts thirty
					seconds to be executed.
					That is because the only core is responsible
					for the thirty sleeps step.
				</listitem>

				<listitem>For the maximum number of cores, the flow is executed much
					faster.
					For more than thirty cores, it lasts only one second. On a thirty
					cores system,
					each sleep is executed by one core, so that a fast distributed
					execution is possible.
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
		</para>

		<para>This flow is parallelizable only because one step of the loop is
			totally independent of another,

			Therefore, all flows with the same characteristic can take advantage of it.
