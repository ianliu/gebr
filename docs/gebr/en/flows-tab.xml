    <para>A way to do this is to copy and paste the flow (see the
      section <xref linkend="flows_copy_paste_del_flows" />.
      Another way is to take a snapshot of the original flow, then edit
      it to the heart desire, and when the user wishes return the
      flow to its original state.
    </para>
    <para> A very useful tool in GêBR is the snapshot. Through a snapshot, GêBR stores the 
    settings of your flow so the user can come back to it later. All snapshots of the 
    flow are presented in the flows tab. To <emphasis role="bold">take a snapshot</emphasis>

    <para>Through a right-click over the target snapshot, the user has the option to execute,

	<para>To deselect a snapshot is as easy as select one, the user just need to click over the

	</para>
	<para>A user that uses different versions of the same flow may also be benefited 
		by the use of snapshots. An option would be to save many different flows, one for 
		each version, which drawback is the pollution of the flows tab. Another option, 
		using the feature above, is taking a snapshot of each version of the flow.
		For instance, in the figure, the user would be storing two versions derived from 'B'. 
	</para>
	<para>The graph indicates from which version each snapshot was derived from. 
		For instance, in the graph of the figure, is possible to see that the snapshot 'B' was 
		based on the snapshot 'A'. 
	</para>
	<note>
		<para>GêBR deals with the idea of origin of the snapshot. In the graph of the figure, 
			'B1' and 'B2' come from 'B' which, by its turn, comes from 'A'. If the user deletes 'B', 
			GêBR will consider 'B1'and 'B2' as originated from 'A'.
