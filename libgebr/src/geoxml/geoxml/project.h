 * Project compounds a list of lines references.
 *
 * Project's idea in analogous to the concept of lines as a container of flows.
 * It groups a number of lines that has some objective in common.
 *
 * Projects references lines using their path.
 * Therefore, a project is a list of lines files. When a line needs to be
 * read or edited you ask the project for its path (see \ref geoxml_project_get_line_source) and then
 * load it with \ref geoxml_document_load. New liness can be added to a project using
 * \ref geoxml_project_add_line, or removed with \ref geoxml_project_remove_line.
 * Iteration can be done combining \ref geoxml_project_get_line and \ref geoxml_project_next_line.
